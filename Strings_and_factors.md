================

## Strings and regex

``` r
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

str_detect(string_vec, "jeff")
```

    ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

``` r
str_replace(string_vec, "jeff", "Jeff")
```

    ## [1] "my"   "name" "is"   "Jeff"

For exact matches, you can designate matches at the beginning or end of
a line.

``` r
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^i think")
```

    ## [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

``` r
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$")
```

    ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

You can designate a list of characters that will count as a match.

``` r
string_vec = c(
  "Time for a Pumpkin Spice Latte!",
  "went to the #pumpkinpatch last weekend",
  "Pumpkin Pie is obviously the best pie",
  "SMASHING PUMPKINS -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )

str_detect(string_vec,"[Pp]umpkin")
```

    ## [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

You don’t have to list these; instead, you can provide a range of
letters or numbers that count as a match.

``` r
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-zA-Z]")
```

    ## [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

The character `.` matches anything.

``` r
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "7.11")
```

    ## [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

Some characters are “special”. These include `[`and`]`, `(`and `)`, and
`..` If you want to search for these, you have to indicate they’re
special using`\`. Unfortunately, `\`is also special, so things get
weird.

``` r
string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "\\[")
```

    ## [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

## Thoughts on factors

``` r
vec_sex = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))
vec_sex
```

    ## [1] male   male   female female
    ## Levels: female male

``` r
as.numeric(vec_sex)
```

    ## [1] 2 2 1 1

``` r
vec_sex = fct_relevel(vec_sex, "male")
vec_sex
```

    ## [1] male   male   female female
    ## Levels: male female

``` r
as.numeric(vec_sex)
```

    ## [1] 1 1 2 2

## NSDUH

``` r
nsduh_url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm"

table_marj = 
  read_html(nsduh_url) |> 
  html_table() |> 
  first() |>
  slice(-1)
```

``` r
data_marj = 
  table_marj |>
  select(-contains("P Value")) |>
  pivot_longer(
    -State,
    names_to = "age_year", 
    values_to = "percent") |>
  separate(age_year, into = c("age", "year"), sep = "\\(") |>
  mutate(
    year = str_replace(year, "\\)", ""),
    percent = str_replace(percent, "[a-c]$", ""),
    percent = as.numeric(percent)) |>
  filter(!(State %in% c("Total U.S.", "Northeast", "Midwest", "South", "West")))
```

## NSDUH – factors

``` r
data_marj |>
  filter(age == "12-17") |> 
  mutate(State = fct_reorder(State, percent)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = percent, color = year)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

\## Restaurant inspections

``` r
data("rest_inspec")

rest_inspec |> 
  group_by(boro, grade) |> 
  summarize(n = n()) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = grade, values_from = n)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'boro'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 8
    ## # Groups:   boro [6]
    ##   boro              A     B     C `Not Yet Graded`     P     Z  `NA`
    ##   <chr>         <int> <int> <int>            <int> <int> <int> <int>
    ## 1 BRONX         13688  2801   701              200   163   351 16833
    ## 2 BROOKLYN      37449  6651  1684              702   416   977 51930
    ## 3 MANHATTAN     61608 10532  2689              765   508  1237 80615
    ## 4 Missing           4    NA    NA               NA    NA    NA    13
    ## 5 QUEENS        35952  6492  1593              604   331   913 45816
    ## 6 STATEN ISLAND  5215   933   207               85    47   149  6730

To simplify things, I’ll remove inspections with scores other than A, B,
or C, and also remove the restaurants with missing boro information.
I’ll also clean up boro names a bit.

``` r
rest_inspec =
  rest_inspec |>
  filter(grade %in% c("A", "B", "C"), boro != "Missing") |> 
  mutate(boro = str_to_title(boro))
```

Let’s focus only on pizza places for now, and re-examine grades by
borough.

``` r
rest_inspec |> 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "Pizza")) |> 
  group_by(boro, grade) |> 
  summarize(n = n()) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = grade, values_from = n)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'boro'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 3
    ## # Groups:   boro [5]
    ##   boro              A     B
    ##   <chr>         <int> <int>
    ## 1 Bronx             9     3
    ## 2 Brooklyn          6    NA
    ## 3 Manhattan        26     8
    ## 4 Queens           17    NA
    ## 5 Staten Island     5    NA

That doesn’t look right – for sure there are more pizza place ratings
than that! The problem is that the match in str_detect is case-sensitive
until we tell it not to be:

``` r
rest_inspec |> 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "[Pp][Ii][Zz][Zz][Aa]")) |> 
  group_by(boro, grade) |> 
  summarize(n = n()) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = grade, values_from = n)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'boro'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 4
    ## # Groups:   boro [5]
    ##   boro              A     B     C
    ##   <chr>         <int> <int> <int>
    ## 1 Bronx          1170   305    56
    ## 2 Brooklyn       1948   296    61
    ## 3 Manhattan      1983   420    76
    ## 4 Queens         1647   259    48
    ## 5 Staten Island   323   127    21

The table is okay but I’d like to visualize this.

``` r
rest_inspec |> 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "[Pp][Ii][Zz][Zz][Aa]")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar() 
```

Might help to have things in a different order – maybe number of pizza
places? Fortunately this can be done using `fct_infreq`.

``` r
rest_inspec |> 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "[Pp][Ii][Zz][Zz][Aa]")) |>
  mutate(boro = fct_infreq(boro)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar() 
```

Suppose I want to rename a borough. I could try using str_replace.

``` r
rest_inspec |> 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "[Pp][Ii][Zz][Zz][Aa]")) |>
  mutate(
    boro = fct_infreq(boro),
    boro = str_replace(boro, "Manhattan", "The City")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar() 
```

<img src="Strings_and_factors_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="90%" />

If I tried base R (maybe because I found some code online), I might try
to do this using `replace`.

``` r
rest_inspec |> 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "[Pp][Ii][Zz][Zz][Aa]")) |>
  mutate(
    boro = fct_infreq(boro),
    boro = replace(boro, which(boro == "Manhattan"), "The City")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `boro = replace(boro, which(boro == "Manhattan"), "The City")`.
    ## Caused by warning in `[<-.factor`:
    ## ! invalid factor level, NA generated

<img src="Strings_and_factors_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="90%" />
Fortunately there is a dedicated function for renaming factor levels:

``` r
rest_inspec |> 
  filter(str_detect(dba, regex("pizza", ignore_case = TRUE))) |>
  mutate(
    boro = fct_infreq(boro),
    boro = fct_recode(boro, "The City" = "Manhattan")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = boro, fill = grade)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
